        <h1>Neck pain relief physotheraphy in lucknow</h1>
        <p>Neck pain often occurs due to incorrect posture and is more common in older people as their bones tend to become weaker with age. However, in recent times, young people are also experiencing neck pain. The primary reason behind this is the excessive use of mobile phones in improper postures, such as lying in bed, sitting incorrectly, or using devices for extended periods without taking breaks.</p>
        <p>This leads to strain on the neck muscles, making them weak and causing pain. Over time, the pressure on the neck bones increases, resulting in further discomfort and weakness in the neck.</p>
        <p>We provide effective solutions and exercises to help reduce and eliminate neck pain without the need for medication. Our physiotherapy services are available at a very affordable price. If you're struggling with neck pain, call us today—we're here to help! Thank you.</p>
